        text: "A summary of 4 key mindsets we have identified within the Gen Z audience. Zoomers are capable of shifting through them at different points in their day and when engaging with different causes. Zoomers may transcend through all of these mindsets, so there isn't one that is more important or more prevalent than another. It's important to understand how to shift between Mindsets for your Gen Z audience, and to learn how to target each of them"

        text: 'Use these Mindset frameworks to understand how to target and interact with Gen Z when they are in different mindsets. Don’t think of these mindsets as Sam the Crowd Following Zoomer or Suzie a Cause Championing Gen Z. Think of Cause Championing as Ella’s mindset when she volunteers with a cancer charity weekly because her grandpa was recently diagnosed with bowel cancer, and Crowd Following as her mindset when she’s on the sofa scrolling through Instagram and reposts a Black Lives Matter infographic on her story so that she’s not the only one who didn’t publicly support the cause.'
