        text: 'During the first 4 weeks of the programme we explored broader and more general attitudes to giving while getting to know our participants and their lives. We dived into their hopes/dreams and aspirations as well their fears/worries and concerns. Our ultimate aim is to uncover powerful insights that will help charities to understand how to become more relevant and find a place in their lives. In the following 6 weeks, we moved from investigating their lives in general, to their perceptions of the charity landscape today and their attitudes and behaviours towards donating; fundraising; campaigning and volunteering - as well as getting them to look at the specific comms and activities of specific charities. The headline objectives of each week are in the Welcome Pack below.'

Whilst we also had two “Fireside Chats”, which are informal speaker events where people had the opportunity to hear some external inspiration from speakers who have a different perspective on Boomer Women.'
